# MonaLisa
## A New Kind of Ethereum Token

ERC-20 tokens in their current forms act not only as currencies, but are mostly used as investment contracts whereas Fiat currencies are used solely as exchange barters for goods and services.

MonaLisa tokens are encapsulated to act as Fiat currencies, but with a twist... The tokens are not to be "bought and sold" via fiat-on-ramp exchanges but rather, only exchanged or "swapped" via decentralized exchanges like Uniswap, etc. *Thus, their market caps will rise and fall based on the exchange rates agreed upon*. 

The goal for MonaLisa tokens are for them to be exchanged into and out of both ERC-20 tokens and Fiat currencies without the act of "buying and selling" the tokens.

### Exchange Rate Mechanics:

***MonaLisa tokens will act as "Personal Currencies"*** so in order for them to be successfully exchanged, they will need the consent of both parties *(like trading one NFT for another OR specifically speaking, trading 1 Yuan for 1 Dollar, or 50 Yuans for 1 Dollar, etc)*.

**Scenario 1:** *Party A agrees to exchange 1 of their Tokens for 1 Token from Party B.*

> ***Before Exchange***
> 
> | Party A Token              | Party B Token              |
> | -------------------------- | -------------------------- |
> | Market Cap = 2kUSD         | Market Cap = 1kUSD         |
> | Tokens In Circulation = 1k | Tokens In Circulation = 1k |
> | 1 Token = 2USD             | 1 Token = 1USD             |
> 
> ***After Exchange***
> 
> | Party A Token              | Party B Token              |
> | -------------------------- | -------------------------- |
> | Market Cap = 1.998kUSD     | Market Cap = 1.002kUSD     |
> | Tokens In Circulation = 1k | Tokens In Circulation = 1k |
> | 1 Token = 1.998USD         | 1 Token = 1.002USD         |

**Scenario 2:** *Party A agrees to exchange 50 of their Tokens for 1 Token from Party B.*

> ***Before Exchange***
> 
> | Party A Token              | Party B Token              |
> | -------------------------- | -------------------------- |
> | Market Cap = 2kUSD         | Market Cap = 1kUSD         |
> | Tokens In Circulation = 1k | Tokens In Circulation = 1k |
> | 1 Token = 2USD             | 1 Token = 1USD             |
> 
> ***After Exchange***
> 
> | Party A Token                 | Party B Token                  |
> | ----------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
> | Market Cap = 1.900kUSD        | Market Cap = 1.100kUSD         |
> | Tokens In Circulation = .951k | Tokens In Circulation = 1.049k |
> | 1 Token = 1.997USD            | 1 Token = 1.048USD             |
