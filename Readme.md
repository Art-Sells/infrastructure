# MonaLisa
## A Combinatorial Auction Ethereum Exchange Rate System

ERC-20 tokens in their current forms act not only as currencies, but are mostly used as investment contracts whereas Fiat currencies are used solely as exchange barters for goods and services.

MonaLisa tokens *(ERC-20 tokens using the MonaLisa system)* are not to be "bought and sold" via fiat-on-ramp exchanges but rather, only exchanged or "swapped" via AMMs (Automated Market Makers like Uniswap, etc). *Thus, their market caps will rise and fall based on the exchange rates agreed upon*. 

The goal for tokens using the MonaLisa system are for them to be exchanged without the act of "buying and selling" the tokens.

### Exchange Rate Mechanics:

In order for MonaLisa tokens to be successfully exchanged, they will need the consent of both parties *(like trading one NFT for another OR specifically speaking, trading 1 Yuan for 1 Dollar, or 50 Yuans for 1 Dollar, etc)*.

**Scenario 1:** *Party A agrees to exchange 1 of their Tokens for 1 Token from Party B.*

> ***Before Exchange***
> 
> | Party A Token              | Party B Token              |
> | -------------------------- | -------------------------- |
> | Market Cap = 2kUSD         | Market Cap = 1kUSD         |
> | Tokens In Circulation = 1k | Tokens In Circulation = 1k |
> | 1 Token = 2USD             | 1 Token = 1USD             |
> 
> ***After Exchange***
> 
> | Party A Token              | Party B Token              |
> | -------------------------- | -------------------------- |
> | Market Cap = 1.998kUSD     | Market Cap = 1.002kUSD     |
> | Tokens In Circulation = 1k | Tokens In Circulation = 1k |
> | 1 Token = 1.998USD         | 1 Token = 1.002USD         |

**Scenario 2:** *Party A agrees to exchange 50 of their Tokens for 1 Token from Party B.*

> ***Before Exchange***
> 
> | Party A Token              | Party B Token              |
> | -------------------------- | -------------------------- |
> | Market Cap = 2kUSD         | Market Cap = 1kUSD         |
> | Tokens In Circulation = 1k | Tokens In Circulation = 1k |
> | 1 Token = 2USD             | 1 Token = 1USD             |
> 
> ***After Exchange***
> 
> | Party A Token                 | Party B Token                  |
> | ----------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
> | Market Cap = 1.900kUSD        | Market Cap = 1.100kUSD         |
> | Tokens In Circulation = .951k | Tokens In Circulation = 1.049k |
> | 1 Token = 1.997USD            | 1 Token = 1.048USD             |
